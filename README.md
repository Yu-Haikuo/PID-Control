# ROS PID Control

## Summary of Project

In this PID Control Project, we are going to use ROS to design a PID feedback-control program which simulates a husky robot going automatically to the pillar and stopping at the desired distance we want, while trying to minimize angular & forward error and time needed to get to the pillar.

## Initial Conditions

The husky robot is starting from origin `(0, 0)`, and the pillar is placing at point `(12.5, 12.5)` based on the calculation result of my matriculation number. The predetermined distance to the pillar that the husky robot would stop at is `1.3`. 

## Design of PID Control

The PID Control Algorithm is implemented in `BotControl::pidAlgorithm()` in BotControl.cpp. First, the algorithm calculates `Dx` and `Dy` as the `x` and `y` distance of husky robot to the pillar. Then, it saves the current forward and angular error as `error_forward_prev` and `error_angle_prev`. After that, it calculates and updates forward and angular error, regularizes the error angle within `[-p, p]`, obtains corresponding integral and derivative items with previously saved forward and angular error, and finally gets the control signal â€“ `trans_angle_` and `trans_forward_`, and publishes all results. In my design of PID Control Algorithm, **only Proportional Control (P Control) is involved.**

## Performance

It can be seen that after tuning, the angular error of the husky robot reaches zero in around five seconds since its first moving, and then keeps at zero after starting, without overshooting. It means the husky robot finds its correct orientation in around five seconds since its starting, and then it keeps pointing to the correct direction without losing the target.

    <em>Forward Error versus Time</em>

<br/>

It is clear to see that the forward error continues to drop since the beginning, and finally reaches zero at 20th second, without overshooting. That means, the husky robot starts moving directly towards the target since the beginning, and finally arrives and stops at predetermined distance we desire at 20th second.
